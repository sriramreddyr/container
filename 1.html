<h1 style="color:blue;">Containers</h1>
<p>Containers is a linux process which runs in isolation.</p>
<p>When we say isolation, each container process will have its own filesystem, resource limits, security context,networks.</p>
<p>Multiple containers can run in isolation on the same machine, thus sharing the same OS Kernel</p>

<p>Virtual Machines vitualize an entire hardware/machine down to hardware layers</p>
<p>Where as Containers only virtualize Software layers above the OS Level</p>
