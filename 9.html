<H3 style="color:blue;">Tags in Container</H3>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Tags are simply labels that provide a better way to manage version control and releases. They are like labels that you can assign to any completed build. Rather than referencing the build ID, you can tag an image with a label in the dev,test,production format and easily be able to tell which image is which.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Tagging is pretty easy. You can use docker tag to do it after the fact, but its much easier to do it when you build using the -t flag:</p> 
<p style="font-size: 20px">docker build -t repository/image:tag .</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px"></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">If you dont specify a specific tag, Docker automatically tags it as latest.</p>
